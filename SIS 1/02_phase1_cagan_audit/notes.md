## Preliminary Conclusions

1. How Air Astana manages work:
- The organization operates primarily through functional units and governed processes, supported by project-style initiatives rather than persistent product teams.

2. Evidence of IT Service mindset:
- IT is consistently described as infrastructure, continuity support, and risk mitigation, indicating a classic IT service and cost-center orientation.

3. Most logical internal bottleneck:
- Procurement.
  Procurement is heavily regulated through standards and manuals, approved at Board level, suggesting high manual effort, risk aversion, and limited automation potential.
