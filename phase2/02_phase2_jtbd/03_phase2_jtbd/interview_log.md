## Procurement Process — Air Astana

**Interviewer:** Product Manager  
**Interviewee:** Senior Procurement Officer (AI Persona)  
**Objective:** Identify the root cause behind slow procurement contract approvals

---

### Question 1:  
**Why does the procurement contract approval process take so long?**

**Answer:**  
Because every supplier contract has to be reviewed manually multiple times. I cannot approve anything quickly since aviation contracts are highly regulated and even a small mistake can cause serious problems.

---

### Question 2:  
**Why does every contract require full manual review instead of using standard templates or automated checks?**

**Answer:**  
Even when we use templates, each supplier has slight variations. Regulations change, and internal policies are strict. I don’t fully trust that templates or systems will catch all compliance issues, so I re-check everything myself.

---

### Question 3:  
**Why don’t you trust existing tools or partial automation to support these checks?**

**Answer:**  
Because if something goes wrong, the responsibility is still on me. The system is not accountable — I am. If an auditor finds a problem, it’s my name attached to the contract, not the tool’s.

---

### Question 4:  
**Why is personal accountability such a strong concern in your daily work?**

**Answer:**  
In aviation, compliance failures can lead to regulatory penalties, reputational damage, or operational disruptions. A single mistake can impact my career. There is no tolerance for errors, so I prefer to be slow but safe.

---

### Question 5:  
**Why is avoiding mistakes more important than speed or operational efficiency?**

**Answer:**  
Because the organization measures success by the absence of problems, not by how fast we work. I am rewarded for zero violations and clean audits, not for faster contract approvals. The system encourages caution over efficiency.

## Key Insight (Root Cause)

The core issue is not process inefficiency or lack of technology.  
The root cause is a risk-averse culture driven by personal accountability, regulatory pressure, and KPI systems that prioritize error avoidance over speed.

As long as procurement officers are individually responsible for compliance outcomes, they will continue to rely on manual reviews, regardless of available digital tools.
