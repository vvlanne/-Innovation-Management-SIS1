# Problem Statement — Procurement at Air Astana

Procurement officers at Air Astana spend excessive time reviewing supplier contracts due to strict aviation regulations, internal policies, and audit requirements.  
The root cause is **fear of errors and personal accountability**, which slows down contract approvals.  
Current tools and templates are insufficient because officers do not fully trust automation in a high-risk environment.
